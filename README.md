## Help needed with maintaining

I am very clueless on this project currently cause this addon was made by SwagOtaku who has done a very great job creating this addon. Be aware that this is a community driven project, so feel free to submit PR's yourself to improve the code and/or help others with support on the issues etc. If you're willing to really participate in the development, please contact me so I can give you write access to the repo. I will do my best to maintain the project for SwagOtaku. Thanks for understanding!
