## Todo List

**_Function_**:
- Watchlist: Automatically mark an anime as completed when the whole series is watched. 
- Watchlist: Want to do a full recode on it sense its very confusing to understand. 
- Artwork: Want to add Simkl as either a main or fallback for Fanart.
- Relations: Want to use Chiaki to get relations but have Anilist relations as a fallback incase Chiaki fails to find that.
	- Api Example: `https://chiaki.vercel.app/get?group_id={malId}`
	- Api Documentation: https://chiaki.vercel.app/

**_Optional_**: 
- Artwork: Want to add an setting to replace anilist posters with simkl posters.
	- I know this is a pointless but will provide anime titles in posters.
	- Will help with skins that don't offer anime titles.
- Embeds: A Setting category to sort your embeds.
- Viewtypes: Want to have a Set Viewtypes options for Menu View, Anime View,and Episode View.
- Accounts: Adding an Easy News Debrid Provider.
