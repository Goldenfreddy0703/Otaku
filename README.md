## Todo List

**_Function_**:
- Context Menu: Source Select needs a recode
- Context Menu: Find Similar needs to be fixed
- Context Menu: We should get rid of context.otaku
- Context Menu: Anime title and Episode Plot does not show during playback when using select source.
- Widgets: No information shows during the playback

**_Optional_**: 
- Embeds: A Setting Catagory to sort your embeds.
- TMDB Players: Need to add an Otaku openplayer for tmdb helper. (Examples: [a4k-openproject](https://github.com/a4k-openproject/json.openplayers))

## Help needed with maintaining

I am very clueless on this project currently cause this addon was made by SwagOtaku who has done a very great job creating this addon. Be aware that this is a community driven project, so feel free to submit PR's yourself to improve the code and/or help others with support on the issues etc. If you're willing to really participate in the development, please contact me so I can give you write access to the repo. I will do my best to maintain the project for SwagOtaku. Thanks for understanding!
